# r79conf

All confs for my Archlinux machines.

Basic idea is that this folder contains all configs, and at the places those would be there are symlinks (check out init.sh if this description was too bad, as the whole magic happens in there).

## What do I have to do?

- git clone this project into your home.
- run ./init.sh for awesomeness.
CAREFUL!
The last step removes all your existing config files without creating backups, as its idea is to run this once when setting up a new machine.

If you don't trust me or just want _some_ of the configs, symlink everything together yourself.

this is a personal thing, so don't expect support, but feel free to steal my ideas, I stole them aswell from here https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-git-to-manage-your-user-configuration-files-on-a-linux-vps#setting-up-your-seed-machine
